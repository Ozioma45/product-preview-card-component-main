## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) - Css framework

### What I learned

This is indeed an interesting and challenging project and i really learnt alot. It has really been a while i designed with bootstrap, so getting to understand it syntax and arrangement was not very use even with the documentation available but am really glad the project gave a broad understanding of the framework

### Continued development

While the Grid system with bootstrap is still not fully clear to me. i intend to use it more often in my future projects for better understanding and implimentation.
